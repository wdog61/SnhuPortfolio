Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was displaying a summary of occurenses of given strings.  This summary was either visual or by text.

What did you do particularly well?
In this project I started to play with string manipulation.  Overall this is a very simple console app and it wasnt a big challenge.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
In theory I could have created a custom object to hold the data/value pairs.  This would allow me to show a better display of the data to the user.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The biggest challenge with this project was trying to employ console colors using ascii codes.  I didnt have enough time to finish out the project so I had to scrap it.  My tools to research this were stackoverflow, google and my knowledge of C#.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
To be honest not a lot.  This was a simple project going in and the most time consuming portion was ensuring it was well commented.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Comments, comments and more comments!!  The biggest helper was the quick creation of the string libraries.  This helped reduce code nessecary for the project.
